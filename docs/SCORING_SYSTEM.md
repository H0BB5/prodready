# ProdReady Scoring System

## Overview

The ProdReady scoring system provides a clear, motivating way to measure code production readiness. Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better production readiness.

## Scoring Philosophy

1. **Meaningful**: Scores reflect real production risk
2. **Motivating**: See improvements immediately
3. **Actionable**: Every point lost has a fix
4. **Contextual**: Payment code held to higher standards
5. **Transparent**: Understand exactly how scores are calculated

## Score Calculation

### Overall Score Formula

```
Overall Score = Weighted Average of Category Scores

Weights:
- Security: 35%
- Reliability: 30%
- Performance: 15%
- Operational: 15%
- Code Quality: 5%
```

### Category Score Calculation

Each category score is calculated as:

```
Category Score = 100 - (Σ Issue Penalties / Maximum Penalty) × 100
```

## Issue Severity and Penalties

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Base Penalty | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Critical | 25 points | Immediate production risk |
| High | 15 points | Significant risk |
| Medium | 8 points | Best practice violation |
| Low | 3 points | Minor improvement |

### Contextual Multipliers

Penalties are multiplied based on context:

```typescript
const contextMultipliers = {
  payment: 2.0,      // Double penalties for payment code
  authentication: 1.5, // 1.5x for auth code
  userData: 1.5,     // 1.5x for personal data
  publicApi: 1.3,    // 1.3x for public endpoints
  internal: 1.0      // Standard for internal code
};
```

### Example Calculation

```typescript
// SQL injection in payment processing code
const penalty = 25 (critical) × 2.0 (payment context) = 50 points

// Missing error handling in internal service
const penalty = 15 (high) × 1.0 (internal) = 15 points
```

## Score Grades

```
A+ | 95-100 | Production Ready! 🌟
A  | 90-94  | Excellent, minor improvements needed
B+ | 85-89  | Very Good, some issues to address
B  | 80-84  | Good, but needs work
C+ | 75-79  | Acceptable, significant improvements needed
C  | 70-74  | Risky, many issues to fix
D  | 60-69  | Poor, major work required
F  | 0-59   | Dangerous, not production ready ⚠️
```

## Category Breakdowns

### 🔒 Security Score (35% weight)

Calculated from security vulnerabilities:

```typescript
const securityIssues = {
  sqlInjection: { severity: 'critical', penalty: 25 },
  xss: { severity: 'high', penalty: 15 },
  hardcodedSecrets: { severity: 'critical', penalty: 25 },
  weakCrypto: { severity: 'high', penalty: 15 },
  missingAuth: { severity: 'critical', penalty: 25 },
  // ... more security issues
};
```

### 🛡️ Reliability Score (30% weight)

Based on error handling and stability:

```typescript
const reliabilityIssues = {
  noErrorHandling: { severity: 'high', penalty: 15 },
  unhandledPromise: { severity: 'high', penalty: 15 },
  noTimeout: { severity: 'medium', penalty: 8 },
  noRetry: { severity: 'medium', penalty: 8 },
  memoryLeak: { severity: 'high', penalty: 15 },
  // ... more reliability issues
};
```

### ⚡ Performance Score (15% weight)

Performance and efficiency issues:

```typescript
const performanceIssues = {
  nPlusOneQuery: { severity: 'high', penalty: 15 },
  noCaching: { severity: 'medium', penalty: 8 },
  noConnectionPool: { severity: 'high', penalty: 15 },
  syncBlocking: { severity: 'high', penalty: 15 },
  largePayload: { severity: 'medium', penalty: 8 },
  // ... more performance issues
};
```

### 📊 Operational Score (15% weight)

Monitoring and operational readiness:

```typescript
const operationalIssues = {
  noLogging: { severity: 'high', penalty: 15 },
  consoleLog: { severity: 'low', penalty: 3 },
  noMetrics: { severity: 'medium', penalty: 8 },
  noHealthCheck: { severity: 'low', penalty: 3 },
  noMonitoring: { severity: 'medium', penalty: 8 },
  // ... more operational issues
};
```

### ✨ Code Quality Score (5% weight)

Maintainability and code quality:

```typescript
const qualityIssues = {
  codeDuplication: { severity: 'medium', penalty: 8 },
  highComplexity: { severity: 'medium', penalty: 8 },
  deadCode: { severity: 'low', penalty: 3 },
  inconsistentStyle: { severity: 'low', penalty: 3 },
  tightCoupling: { severity: 'medium', penalty: 8 },
  // ... more quality issues
};
```

      quality: 0.05
    };
    
    const overall = Object.entries(categoryScores).reduce(
      (sum, [category, score]) => sum + score * weights[category],
      0
    );
    
    return {
      overall: Math.round(overall),
      categories: categoryScores,
      grade: this.getGrade(overall)
    };
  }
  
  calculateCategoryScore(issues: Issue[]): number {
    const totalPenalty = issues.reduce((sum, issue) => {
      const basePenalty = this.getPenalty(issue.severity);
      const multiplier = this.getContextMultiplier(issue.context);
      return sum + (basePenalty * multiplier);
    }, 0);
    
    // Cap maximum penalty at 100 points
    return Math.max(0, 100 - Math.min(totalPenalty, 100));
  }
}
