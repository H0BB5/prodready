# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## ProdReady: Production-Ready Code Wrapper Service

### Version 1.0
### Last Updated: June 2025

---

## Executive Summary

ProdReady is a developer tool that automatically transforms AI-generated code into production-ready applications. It addresses the critical gap between functional prototypes created by AI tools and the comprehensive requirements of production systems.

Our vision: **Become the standard quality gate for AI-generated code, making production-ready development accessible to millions of new developers.**

## Problem Statement

### The AI Code Quality Crisis

1. **Explosion of AI-Generated Code**: Millions of developers now use ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and similar tools
2. **Hidden Technical Debt**: AI generates functionally correct but production-unsafe code
3. **Knowledge Gap**: New developers don't know what they don't know about production requirements
4. **Security Time Bomb**: Vulnerable AI-generated code is being deployed at scale

### Current Solution Gaps

- **AI Tools** (Copilot, ChatGPT): Generate code but don't review or fix existing code
- **Static Analysis** (SonarQube, CodeQL): Too complex, enterprise-focused, don't auto-fix
- **Linters** (ESLint, Pylint): Only catch style issues, not production concerns
- **IDEs**: Require manual configuration, don't understand AI patterns

## Solution Overview

### Core Value Proposition

**"Transform any AI-generated code into production-ready applications with one command"**

### Key Differentiators

1. **Instant Transformation**: Watch your code evolve from prototype to production in real-time
2. **Educational**: Every fix includes explanations, turning mistakes into learning opportunities  
3. **Context-Aware**: Understands that payment code needs PCI compliance, user data needs GDPR
4. **AI-Pattern Recognition**: Specifically designed to detect and fix common AI-generated anti-patterns
5. **Beautiful Developer Experience**: Makes code quality improvement feel rewarding, not punishing
