## The Problem

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot generate functionally correct code, but it's rarely production-ready. The code often lacks:
- ‚ùå Error handling
- ‚ùå Security measures  
- ‚ùå Logging & monitoring
- ‚ùå Rate limiting
- ‚ùå Input validation
- ‚ùå Connection pooling
- ‚ùå And dozens of other production concerns...

## The Solution

ProdReady automatically transforms your AI-generated prototype into production-grade code:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g prodready

# Scan your project
prodready scan ./

# üò± Your AI-generated API scored 23/100

# Transform it
prodready fix

# üéâ Your code is now 95/100 production-ready!
```
